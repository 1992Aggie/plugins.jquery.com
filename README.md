# plugins.jquery.com

This is the source for the jQuery Plugins site, plugins.jquery.com

## How does it work?

The jQuery Plugins site is built from plugin metadata in GitHub
repositories. Each repository can contain at most a single jQuery
plugin described by a file in the root directory named `package.json`.
A DRAFT spec for this package.json is under development at

https://github.com/jquery/jquery-plugins/blob/master/docs/json.md

## How to list a plugin

Add the GitHub repo url to index.md, like so

`* http://github.com/username/reponame`
